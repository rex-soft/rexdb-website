			<h3>稳定版本</h3>
			<p>通过了完整的测试，预计可以稳定运行于生产环境，但有可能包含少量的BUG。</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>More users:</strong> By removing complexities associated
						with deploying applications in the cloud and by providing more
						applications for users to run. Bitnami also helps to drive new
						users to our cloud partner’s platforms. We connect the millions
						of Bitnami users who are increasingly deploying applications in
						the cloud to our cloud platform partners to ensure a seamless
						transition.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>More consumption per user:</strong> By enabling a higher
						success rate for new deployments and by attracting more business
						users, who tend to run applications for longer periods of time on
						bigger servers.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<strong>More use cases:</strong> By making it much easier for
						users to evaluate, develop and test applications in the cloud.
					</p>
				</li>

			<h3>测试版本</h3>
			<p>With Bitnami, users can begin running applications and stacks in
				the cloud in minutes. Bitnami cloud images are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Free for users</li>
				<li>Fast and easy to run</li>
				<li>Always the latest production-ready version</li>
				<li>Pre-configured and optimized for your cloud environment</li>
				<li>Easily ported from local server or virtual environments to your
					cloud platform</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Bitnami makes it significantly easier for users to get up and
				running on your cloud platform. No longer do users need to research
				version numbers and related dependencies, integrate and configure
				components, and optimize settings. Bitnami images are fully tested
				and proven to work in cloud environments, allowing users to begin
				running their preferred open source applications and stacks in your
				cloud platform in only a few clicks.</p>

			<h3>Enable a vibrant ecosystem</h3>
			<p>Let's face it. Convincing software vendors to invest engineering
				resources to create and support cloud images for multiple cloud
				platforms can be a tricky sell. Fortunately, this is one of the
				problems that Bitnami solves for our cloud partners.</p>
			<p>
				Not only does Bitnami provide cloud-ready images of more than 130
				popular applications and developer stacks, we regularly add new
				open source and commercial options to our library. Want to add new
				ISVs to your cloud portfolio? Simply connect them with Bitnami and
				let us take care of the rest. The <strong>Bitnami Software Partner</strong>
				program was created to help ISVs expand the addressable market for
				their applications by making it easier to run their applications in
				the cloud and everywhere else.
			</p>
			<p>Bitnami also helps to attract developers to our partner's cloud
				platforms by making it much easier to develop and test applications
				in the cloud. In minutes, users can launch complete, standardized
				development stacks and tool sets for a single developer or a
				complete development team.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Supercharge your marketplace</h3>
			<p>Bitnami is the leading provider of cloud-ready images to many of
				the industry’s leading marketplaces, including Amazon Web Services,
				Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and VMware.</p>
			<p>
				When we partner with cloud providers we ensure that every image is
				ported tested and optimized for your cloud platform. It means
				providing your users with instant access to a rapidly growing
				library of ready-to-run images for more than 130 popular
				applications such as <a href="/stack/alfresco">Alfresco</a>, <a
					href="/stack/drupal">Drupal</a>, <a href="/stack/ghost">Ghost</a>,
